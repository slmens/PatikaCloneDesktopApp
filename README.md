# PatikaCloneDesktopApp

This project was prepared for Patika+ bootcamp. My aim is to copy the Patika+ website as a desktop app.

Let me tell you about the project first. There are 3 different users in our project: student, operator and educator. We need to prepare 3 different GUIs for these 3 different users because students can only register for courses and view the content, while operators do many other things that they cannot do. In the project, I used Java SwingGUI and a mysql server running locally. Although there are still a few bugs, I thought it would be okay to create a readme file.

First, let's start with the operator. Operators can view, modify, delete and add courses, Patika's (Patika is a Turkish word and means path) and users.

Let's move on to our next user, our educators. Educators can't do most of the things operators do. Their job is to add, edit, and delete course content when necessary.

And finally, students. Students cannot do anything except enroll in courses on the Patika's, look at the course content, and solve quizzes.

And thats it. Thank you for reading.
